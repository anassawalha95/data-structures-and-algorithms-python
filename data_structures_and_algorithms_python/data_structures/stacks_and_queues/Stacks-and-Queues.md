# Stacks and Queues

Stacks & Queues it is the famous data structures in the world... its good way to orgnize data and know how to deal with it

### Challenge

Creating stacks & Queues methouds was one of the most good challenge to do, it was easy and learned alot about the algorithms.


### Approach & Efficiency

I used stack and queue data structure to learn how the data or processes will executed in the computer with different approaches

### API

alot of methouds to use like:

***Stack:***

**push:** it takes one value as argument and push it to the top of the stack

**pop:** it pop the node in the top of the stack..

**peek:** returns to you the value of the node in the top of the stack..

**is_empty:** returns boolen if the stack is empty or not..

***Queue:***

**enqueue:** it takes one value as argument and add it to the rear of the queue

**dequeue:** it pop the node in the fornt of the queue..

**peek:** returns to you the value of the node in the front of the queue..

**isEmpty:** returns boolen if the queue is empty or not..
