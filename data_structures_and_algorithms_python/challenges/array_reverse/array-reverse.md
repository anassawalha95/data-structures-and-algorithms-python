# Reverse an Array

* Create an algorithm that akes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to Python language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Challenge

* Find best Algorithm to use in reversing the array

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
* I Used the for loop to iterate through the array.

* It's easy way to iterate through the array but it's not the best way.

**The Big O for this Algorithm**

* For performance: O(n)
